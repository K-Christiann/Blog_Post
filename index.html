       <h3>The Journey of Jesus Christ(A brief Overview)  </h3>
       <section>
         <ul>
          <li>Jesus of Nazareth, believed by Christians to be the Son of God and the Savior of humanity, was born in Bethlehem over 2,000 years ago. His birth, heralded by angels and marked by a star, fulfilled ancient prophecies of the Messiah. Raised in the town of Nazareth by Mary and Joseph, Jesus grew up in a religious Jewish family. As a young man, he was baptized by John the Baptist and began his public ministry, spreading a message of love, repentance, and the coming Kingdom of God.</li>
          <li>For about three years, Jesus traveled across the region, preaching, healing the sick, performing miracles, and challenging societal norms. He spoke in parables, offering profound spiritual teachings that emphasized forgiveness, compassion, and humility. His message attracted large crowds but also drew the ire of religious leaders and Roman authorities who felt threatened by his influence and claims of divine authority. Despite his growing popularity, Jesus remained focused on his mission of reconciling humanity with God.</li>
          <li>Jesus’ life culminated in a final week in Jerusalem, known as the Passion. During this time, he celebrated the Passover meal with his disciples, instituting what would later become the Christian practice of Communion. Betrayed by one of his own followers, Judas Iscariot, Jesus was arrested, tried, and sentenced to crucifixion under the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate. His death on the cross, a sacrifice for the sins of the world, is central to Christian belief, symbolizing God’s love and the promise of salvation.</li>
          <li>Three days after his death, Jesus rose from the dead, an event celebrated as the cornerstone of Christian faith: the Resurrection. His victory over death demonstrated his divine nature and affirmed his message of eternal life. After appearing to his disciples and followers over forty days, he ascended into heaven, promising to send the Holy Spirit to guide and empower his followers.</li>
          <li>The teachings of Jesus have had a profound impact on history, shaping the foundations of Christianity and influencing billions of people worldwide. His life continues to inspire individuals across cultures and religions to pursue lives of love, service, and faith. Christians believe that Jesus will one day return to judge the living and the dead, fulfilling God’s ultimate plan for the world.</li>
